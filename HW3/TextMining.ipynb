Literature review \\\\nBlockchain technology as a part of the fourth industrial revolution is new to this world. The subject started gaining attention among researchers post-2016 after the introduction of cryptocurrency exchanges and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a mode of digital payment in some major economies of the world. The technology has been widely applied in all the major areas of research including education', ' the Internet of Things', ' banking', ' supply-chain', ' health care', ' defense', ' governance', ' etc. (Yaqoob \\\\net \\\\nal.', '2019; Hasselgren \\\\net \\\\nal.', ' \\\\n2020). However', ' studies have also found that the application of blockchain is extremely immature and lacks public knowledge', ' making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true futur\",\n",
       " \" potential. Presently', ' there are issues with scalability', ' the security of smart contracts and user adoption (Radanovi\\\\x01c \\\\nand \\\\nLiki\\\\x01c', ' \\\\n2018). It is believed that blockchain technology may bring signi.cant changes in the connections between schools', ' colleges', ' universities and', ' thus', ' their relationship to society. \\\\nTo better demonstrate', ' some of the signi.cant contributions made by the existing studies are presented in Table \\\\n1. \\\\nThe detailed surveys of the literature suggest the blockchain to be an evolving area of study which has tremendous application in education. The uses lie in student’s data and credentials management', ' administration activities', ' teaching and learning in schools and universities using online and brick and mortar systems. The technology has been put to use in all .elds of education including', ' engineering medicine', ' logistics', ' retail', ' marketing and .nance. \\\\nFurther', ' the year-wise and area-wise study on the topic around the globe has been presented. Figure \\\\n3 \\\\npresents the break-up distribution of publications in the area. The graph suggests the area of blockchain technology in education is new and has started receiving attention starting 2017 from where it has been consistently growing and seems to grow in the times to come. \\\\nFigure \\\\n4 \\\\ndepicts the year wise citation which is not impressive suggesting that being a new area of study the citations are limited. There lies tremendous scope to apply and carry research in the application of technology in the education system. \\\\nFigure \\\\n5 \\\\npresents country-wise publications in this emerging .eld of study. It can be observed that the researchers from the USA (seven) have the highest number of publications followed by India (5)', ' Russia', ' Spain and China representing three publications each. Looking at less contribution', ' the application of blockchain technology in education becomes an area to study and explore in various parts of the world. \\\\nTable \\\\n2 \\\\nrepresents the studies on the topic with the maximum number of citations for the three years period starting 2017. \\\\nFrom Table \\\\n3', ' it can be observed that most of the published work is in the journals covering the topics of science and technology', ' medicine', ' marketing', ' law at school and higher education. This suggests that block technology and its application in education is a multidisciplinary area of research. Further', ' the number of publications is limited to a maximum of three publications per journal.

We also present the year-wise and geography wise publications along with article wise citations of publications to better understand the current state of literature. \\n3. Literature review \\nBlockchain technology as a part of the fourth industrial revolution is new to this world. The subject started gaining attention among researchers post-2016 after the introduction of cryptocurrency exchanges and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a mode of digital payment in some major economies of the world. The technology has been widely applied in all the major areas of research including education', ' the Internet of Things', ' banking', ' supply-chain', ' health care', ' defense', ' governance', ' etc. (Yaqoob \\net \\nal.', '2019; Hasselgren \\net \\nal.', ' \\n2020). However', ' studies have also found that the application of blockchain is extremely immature and lacks public knowledge', ' making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true futur\n",
      " potential. Presently', ' there are issues with scalability', ' the security of smart contracts and user adoption (Radanovi\\x01c \\nand \\nLiki\\x01c', ' \\n2018). It is believed that blockchain technology may bring signi.cant changes in the connections between schools', ' colleges', ' universities and', ' thus', ' their relationship to society. \\nTo better demonstrate', ' some of the signi.cant contributions made by the existing studies are presented in Table \\n1. \\nThe detailed surveys of the literature suggest the blockchain to be an evolving area of study which has tremendous application in education. The uses lie in student’s data and credentials management', ' administration activities', ' teaching and learning in schools and universities using online and brick and mortar systems. The technology has been put to use in all .elds of education including', ' engineering medicine', ' logistics', ' retail', ' marketing and .nance. \\nFurther', ' the year-wise and area-wise study on the topic around the globe has been presented. Figure \\n3 \\npresents the break-up distribution of publications in the area. The graph suggests the area of blockchain technology in education is new and has started receiving attention starting 2017 from where it has been consistently growing and seems to grow in the times to come. \\nFigure \\n4 \\ndepicts the year wise citation which is not impressive suggesting that being a new area of study the citations are limited. There lies tremendous scope to apply and carry research in the application of technology in the education system. \\nFigure \\n5 \\npresents country-wise publications in this emerging .eld of study. It can be observed that the researchers from the USA (seven) have the highest number of publications followed by India (5)', ' Russia', ' Spain and China representing three publications each. Looking at less contribution', ' the application of blockchain technology in education becomes an area to study and explore in various parts of the world. \\nTable \\n2 \\nrepresents the studies on the topic with the maximum number of citations for the three years period starting 2017. \\nFrom Table \\n3', ' it can be observed that most of the published work is in the journals covering the topics of science and technology', ' medicine', ' marketing', ' law at school and higher education. This suggests that block technology and its application in education is a multidisciplinary area of research. Further', ' the number of publications is limited to a maximum of three publications per journal. This suggests the need to explore the area further for publication covering school education', ' online education and subjects of social sciences', ' business and management education. \\n4. Results and discussion \\nBased on the systematic review', ' it can be observed that most of the studies examined the blockchain technology in education were qualitative (Abdeldayem \\nand \\nAldulaimi', ' \\n2020; Jirgensons \\nand \\nKapenieks', ' \\n2018; Grewal \\net \\nal.', ' \\n2018) and review based (Karale \\nand \\nKhanuja', ' \\n2019; Hasselgren \\net \\nal.', '2020).

Introduction\\nComputer Science innovations play a major role in everyday life as they change and\\nenrich human interaction', ' communication and social transactions. From the standpoint of\\nend users', ' three major technological innovation waves have been recorded centered around\\nthe introduction of personal computers', ' the Internet and mobile devices', ' respectively. Cur-\\nrently', ' the fourth wave of computing innovation is unfolding around spatial', ' immersive\\ntechnologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) [ 1]. This wave is ex-\\npected to form the next ubiquitous computing paradigm that has the potential to transform\\n(online) education', ' business', ' remote work and entertainment. This new paradigm is the\\nMetaverse. The word Metaverse is a closed compound word with two components: Meta\\n(Greek prefix meaning post', ' after or beyond) and universe. In other words', ' the Metaverse is\\na post-reality universe', ' a perpetual and persistent multiuser environment merging physical\\nreality with digital virtuality. Regarding online distance education', ' Metaverse has the\\npotential to remedy the fundamental limitations of web-based 2D e-lear\n",
      "ing tools.\\nEducation is one crucial field for society and economy where core implementation\\nmethods remain unchanged and orbiting around content transmission', ' classrooms and\\ntextbooks despite numerous technological innovations [ 2]. Currently', ' there is an intense\\nrace to construct the infrastructure', ' protocols and standards that will govern the Metaverse.\\nLarge corporations are striving to construct their closed', ' proprietary hardware and software\\necosystems so as to attract users and become the de facto Metaverse destination. Different\\nsystemic approaches and diverging strategies collide around concepts such as openness\\nand privacy. The outcome of this race will determine the level of users’ privacy rights\\nas well as whether the Metaverse will be inclusive to students and school pupils. Both\\nissues have important implications for education as they will determine if the Metaverse\\ncan become mainstream in e-learning. The aim of this article is to raise awareness about\\nthe origin and the affordances of the Metaverse', ' so as to formulate a unified vision for\\nmeta-education', ' Metaverse-powered online distance education.\\nFor this purpose', ' this article is structured as follows: Definitions of the key concepts\\nare presented in Section 2. The limitations of two-dimensional learning environments are\\nEncyclopedia 2022', ' 2', ' 486–497. https://doi.org/10.3390/encyclopedia2010031 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/encyclopedia\\nEncyclopedia 2022', ' 2 487\\nsummarized in Section 3. A brief historical account of virtual media and VR technology\\nis illustrated in Section 4. Next', ' in Section 5', ' the significance of virtual worlds and VR for\\neducation is presented. Section 6 is dedicated to contemporary Metaverse development', '\\nMeta-education and innovative applications. The conclusions are in the final Section 7.\\n2. Extended', ' Virtual', ' Augmented and Mixed Reality\\nExtended Reality or Cross Reality (XR) is an umbrella term that includes a series of\\nimmersive technologies; electronic', ' digital environments where data are represented and\\nprojected. XR includes Virtual Reality (VR)', ' Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality\\n(MR) [ 3]. In all the above-mentioned XR facets', ' humans observe and interact in a fully or\\npartially synthetic digital environment constructed by technology.\\nVR is an alternate', ' completely separate', ' digitally created', ' artificial environment. Users\\nfeel in VR that they are immersed', ' located in a different world and operate in similar\\nways just like in the physical surroundings [ 4]. With the help of specialized multisensory\\nequipment such as immersion helmets', ' VR headsets and omnidirectional treadmills', ' this\\nexperience is amplified through the modalities of vision', ' sound', ' touch', ' movement and the\\nnatural interaction with virtual objects [5', '6].\\nAR adopts a different approach towards physical spaces; it embeds digital inputs', '\\nvirtual elements into the physical environment so as to enhance it [ 7]. It spatially merges\\nthe physical with the virtual world [8]. The end outcome is a spatially projected layer of\\ndigital artifacts mediated by devices', ' e\n",
      "g.', ' smart phones', ' tablets', ' glasses', ' contact lenses or\\nother transparent surfaces [9 ]. Moreover', ' AR can also be implemented in VR headsets with\\npass-through mode capability by displaying input from integrated camera sensors.\\nMR is a more complex concept and its definition has fluctuated across time', ' reflect-\\ning the contemporary technological trends and dominant linguistic meanings and narra-\\ntives [10 ]. MR is sometimes represented as an advanced AR iteration in the sense that\\nthe physical environment interacts in real time with the projected digital data [10 ]. For\\ninstance', ' a scripted non-player character in an MR game would recognize the physical\\nsurroundings and hide behind under a desk or behind a couch. Similar to VR', ' MR requires\\nspecial glasses. However', ' for the purpose of this article', ' we accept the conception of MR\\nas any combination of AR and VR as well as intermediate variations such as augmented\\nvirtuality [3 ]. The rationale behind this decision is the long-term technological evolution\\nand maturation of AR to include interactive affordances. Therefore', ' AR and VR remain the\\ntwo fundamental technologies and MR their combination.\\nTo comprehend and visualize how these immersive technologies interact with the\\nenvironment', ' we point to Milgram and Kishino’s one-dimensional reality–virtuality con-\\ntinuum [3 ]. This continuum is illustrated as a straight line with two ends. On the left\\nextremum of the line there is the natural', ' physical environment. The right end marks the\\nfully artificial', ' virtual environment that the user experiences instead of the physical one.\\nHence', ' AR is near the left end of the spectrum while VR occupies the right extremum. MR\\nis a superset of both.\\nMultimodal Metaverse Interactions\\nThe Metaverse is based on technologies that enable multisensory interactions with\\nvirtual environments', ' digital objects and people. The representational fidelity of the\\nXR system is enabled by stereoscopic displays that are able to convey the perception of\\ndepth [ 11]. This is possible with separate and slightly different displays for each eye that\\nreplicate sight in physical environments [ 11 ]. XR displays with high resolutions activate a\\nwide user field of view that can span from 90 to 180 degrees. XR systems also offer superior\\nauditory experiences in comparison to 2D systems. 3D', ' spatial or binaural audio allows\\nthe construction of soundscapes that enhance immersion decisively in AR and VR [12 ].\\nThe spatial distribution of sound allows users to orientate themselves and identify the\\ndirections of sound cues', ' a powerful medium for navigation and user attention attraction.\\n']\n"
